2020-07-31 14:05:16	+azahi	btw icy are you learning German?
2020-07-31 14:05:47	+icy	no azahi 
2020-07-31 14:05:55	+icy	russian, actually
2020-07-31 14:06:05	+icy	i have to get back to studying it properly
2020-07-31 14:06:12	+azahi	for what purpose?
2020-07-31 14:06:16	+icy	for fun
2020-07-31 14:06:33	+icy	and Russian culture/history is very interesting 
2020-07-31 14:07:25	+azahi	damn I've been thinking lately. It's probably insanely hard to learn russian for someone completely unfamiliar with it
2020-07-31 14:07:29	+azahi	it's so fucking irregular
2020-07-31 14:07:49	+azahi	I can juggle these irregularities intuitively but actually making sense of these
2020-07-31 14:07:52	+azahi	is beyond me
2020-07-31 14:07:54	+icy	it is
2020-07-31 14:07:57	+icy	but surprisingly 
2020-07-31 14:08:03	+icy	quite similar grammatically 
2020-07-31 14:08:06	+icy	to hindi
2020-07-31 14:08:29	+icy	so the basic grammar has been p easy to pick up
2020-07-31 14:08:48	+azahi	can you place verbs or subject/object in any order you want in hindi?
2020-07-31 14:09:05	+icy	actually yeah
2020-07-31 14:09:09	+icy	for ex
2020-07-31 14:09:17	+icy	"mein nahi karta"

2020-07-31 14:11:38	+icy	nope
2020-07-31 14:11:42	+icy	it's very common
2020-07-31 14:11:49	+azahi	i c
2020-07-31 14:12:05	+icy	vocabs are hard in RU though
2020-07-31 14:12:17	+icy	as with any new lang i guess
2020-07-31 14:12:26	+azahi	conjugations are probably really hard to do
2020-07-31 14:12:35	+azahi	you can literally do anything with a word in russian
2020-07-31 14:12:42	+icy	ah yeah i haven't fully nailed that down yet

2020-07-31 14:15:47	+azahi	enju: do you find polish at least a bit mutually intelligible with german?
2020-07-31 14:16:28	@enju	not at all
2020-07-31 14:16:35	@enju	polish is not a Germanic language
2020-07-31 14:17:01	@enju	its indogermanic, but slav, its so far removed
2020-07-31 14:17:16	+azahi	yes it's a slavonic language but had some exchange with german iirc
2020-07-31 14:17:44	@enju	yeah no i dont understand anything in polish
2020-07-31 14:17:54	+azahi	interesting
2020-07-31 14:18:40	@enju	its not like Germanic languages
2020-07-31 14:18:43	@enju	which I can almost all read
2020-07-31 14:20:27	+azahi	enju: what about finnish? I know it's also not germanic
2020-07-31 14:21:39	@enju	thats not even indo germanic lmao

2020-08-01 00:25:29	luxemboye	i liked the idea of editing tags *using* ncmpcpp (and mpd)
2020-08-01 00:25:51	luxemboye	means i don't need another piece of bloated software i'd rarely use
2020-08-01 00:27:03	luxemboye	or at least crappy software most of the time for tag editors
2020-08-01 00:38:06	wakamiya	lpf: yeah looking to get rid of awesomes own bar, i don't like it

2020-08-01 00:44:29	lpf	it's a pretty ambitious choice for a first linux experiende
2020-08-01 00:44:31	lpf	experience
2020-08-01 00:44:57	lpf	though about 6 years before that i had a brush with whatever ubuntu used back then

2020-08-02 12:27:23	wakamiya	alright so newbie question
2020-08-02 12:27:41	wakamiya	isnt it the "screen" plugin from oh-my-zsh that i want to use to accompish titled urxvt-windows?
2020-08-02 12:27:53	wakamiya	so they show up as something else than just "urxvt" when i exec something 
2020-08-02 12:27:57	wakamiya	in the bar
2020-08-02 12:28:14	wakamiya	added it to my .zshrc but doesnt seem to be that
2020-08-02 12:28:40	lpf	i have no idea i have my bar display window class rather than window name
2020-08-02 12:28:54	lpf	so i pretty much don't use window names

2020-08-02 12:30:05	wakamiya	just executing "screen" seems to do it
2020-08-02 12:30:22	lpf	you haven't seen every anime anime worth watching stop relying on your so and actually look
2020-08-02 12:30:33	wakamiya	tfw you sit for hours to solve something and you just need to execute it
2020-08-02 12:30:39	wakamiya	what am i missing?
2020-08-02 12:30:44	wakamiya	anime wise
2020-08-02 12:31:06	wakamiya	we're into mystery anime
2020-08-02 12:31:12	lpf	you are using gnu screen the multiplexer?
2020-08-02 12:31:21	wakamiya	no idea what that is
2020-08-02 12:31:31	lpf	like you're running the command `screen`?
2020-08-02 12:31:35	wakamiya	i did now yes
2020-08-02 12:32:58	wakamiya	i should probably read wtf it is
2020-08-02 12:33:06	lpf	multiplexers like screen and tmux do a lot of things so eventually you should look into what other things it does than manage window name
2020-08-02 12:33:49	wakamiya	yeah, it starts off by me trying to accomplish something, then curiosity takes over and wants to make me understand what im actually using/doing
2020-08-02 12:35:42	lpf	also, i don't know what you've seen in the past two years nor which of those you'd like but i have 134 entries rated 8+ that aren't on your list (although my scores are garbage and inconsistent) 
2020-08-02 12:35:54	wakamiya	probably seen those
2020-08-02 12:36:00	wakamiya	i followed seasonal anime
2020-08-02 12:36:11	wakamiya	but hit me
2020-08-02 12:36:12	lpf	i haven't seen seasonal anime in 5 years
2020-08-02 12:36:23	lpf	most of those are older lol
2020-08-02 12:36:36	wakamiya	im just surprised there are literally 134 entries total that score 8+
2020-08-02 12:36:53	lpf	i love anime
2020-08-02 12:37:11	wakamiya	theres something out there for everyone in regards to anime
2020-08-02 12:37:15	wakamiya	just less so depending on your taste
2020-08-02 12:37:36	wakamiya	psycho-pass season 1 is probably my all time most pleasured anime
2020-08-02 12:37:47	wakamiya	since it rips off "Hannibal" the TV show, thats my favorite TV show
2020-08-02 12:37:56	wakamiya	but anime like these are too rare
2020-08-02 12:38:10	+pong	lpf: coffee time
2020-08-02 12:38:23	lpf	i didn't see hannibal but i watched american gods recently
2020-08-02 12:38:25	wakamiya	if you filter out shounen shit, plot armored mary stu/sues, fan service filled shit
2020-08-02 12:38:29	wakamiya	then not much left
2020-08-02 12:39:25	lpf	did you watch ghost in the shell stand alone complex? it's pretty similar to psycho pass
2020-08-02 12:39:38	lpf	but i liked it more at the time
2020-08-02 12:40:28	lpf	cus of stuff like psycho pass introducing hyper oats when the plot needs them vs gits sac introducing concepts in stand alone episodes ahead of them becoming relevant in the overarching plot
2020-08-02 12:40:41	lpf	not that i remember the details of either at that point
2020-08-02 12:40:55	wakamiya	it was a long time ago i tried watching GiTS
2020-08-02 12:41:04	wakamiya	dropped it pretty early iirc, but dont remember what it was like exactly
2020-08-02 12:41:33	lpf	pong: you made me check techlead's channel no new video
2020-08-02 12:41:41	lpf	im gonna get some coffee though i guess

2020-08-02 12:44:58	+pong	macos does not have the font problem
2020-08-02 12:44:58	lpf	also i removed all my scores under 5 at some point
2020-08-02 12:45:00	wakamiya	you seem to have scored it 10
2020-08-02 12:45:07	wakamiya	cant tell
2020-08-02 12:45:09	lpf	except a few to show off the emojis
2020-08-02 12:45:19	lpf	100 is 10 yea
2020-08-02 12:45:35	lpf	musisi is great
2020-08-02 12:46:07	lpf	the mystery is pretty light
2020-08-02 12:47:01	wakamiya	dropped zankyou no terror
2020-08-02 12:47:27	lpf	i don't remember anything about it or if i finished it
2020-08-02 12:47:40	wakamiya	other drops seem justified
2020-08-02 12:48:07	lpf	a lot of things i just put there cause i never got around to finishing them 
2020-08-02 12:48:28	wakamiya	its not bad
2020-08-02 12:48:33	wakamiya	probably an 8 if i were to rate it
2020-08-02 12:49:01	wakamiya	not the most well written stuff but it passes the time for sure
2020-08-02 12:49:08	lpf	i probably never got around to finishing it
2020-08-02 12:49:47	lpf	my scores are garbage because
2020-08-02 12:49:54	lpf	my memory erases itself very quickly
2020-08-02 12:50:08	lpf	and since joining mal both my taste and my scoring system changed many times
2020-08-02 12:50:12	lpf	so nothing is consistent
2020-08-02 12:51:08	lpf	my unrated anime are fifty fifty old scores below 5 that i censored, and actual stuff i just didn't know what to rate or couldn't be bothered to

2020-08-07 22:09:36	+dysfigured	it's dope because it has near feature parity with fzf and nearly the same api so you can write scripts that uses either fzf or sk depending on which is installed/available
2020-08-07 22:09:52	+dysfigured	but sk is especially cool because you can import it as a rust lib
2020-08-07 22:11:13	+dysfigured	i literally started learning rust just to use sk as a lib instead of wrapping it with bash/python/nodejs, but then got kinda fucked off because rust is hard

2020-08-09 17:57:47	luxemboye	realbadhorse: its impressive tbh, because i thought their VPS offers weren't really powerful. The only reason i like BuyVM is because of how fran handles privacy, tor and dmca and stuff
2020-08-09 17:57:50	+icy	eti: agreed
2020-08-09 17:58:14	+icy	you'll have to add a security group rule to allow all TCP/UDP traffic eti or you can't do anything but ssh

2020-08-09 18:28:42	realbadhorse	and the same person, unironically, while using BGI for rendering, said that this algorithm is unoptimised because `mul` instructions has more cpu cycles than `add` instuctions

2020-08-09 18:29:00	+icy	you're using asm in C?

2020-08-09 18:35:23	realbadhorse	The only reason I switched to kde is because xfce dropped support for pango or whatever font library it was that did bitmaps

2020-08-09 18:36:08	realbadhorse	I get it that its bloated but at the same time its comfi as fuck

2020-08-09 18:44:43	realbadhorse	ah yes
2020-08-09 18:44:50	luxemboye	just setup an irc client and terminal multiplexer tbh
2020-08-09 18:45:41	realbadhorse	on the remote?
2020-08-09 18:45:47	luxemboye	yeah
2020-08-09 18:46:11	realbadhorse	I could but theres a little bit of input lag with ssh and its really annoying for usage on a long term
2020-08-09 18:46:31	luxemboye	oh yeah
2020-08-09 18:46:43	realbadhorse	(as i said, i dont have the best peering)
2020-08-09 18:46:48	luxemboye	when im on the go i use mosh to not have too many issues with that
2020-08-09 18:47:08	realbadhorse	mosh is that ssh thing that uses deltas?
2020-08-09 18:47:18	luxemboye	i prefer this approach because i just need an ssh client on my machines
2020-08-09 18:47:30	luxemboye	ssh/mosh*
2020-08-09 18:47:54	realbadhorse	yep, thats it
2020-08-09 18:48:19	luxemboye	you just need to install it on the server and have it on the client, it uses ssh to login
2020-08-09 18:48:26	luxemboye	oh and UDP ports
2020-08-09 18:48:43	realbadhorse	Ill give mosh a shot
2020-08-09 18:51:33	luxemboye	i mean if you only use one machine, or have irc clients that are set up on all of your machines why not do the bouncer stuff

2020-08-09 18:52:58	realbadhorse	any recommendations on a bitmap-friendly terminal with sane configs?

2020-08-09 21:08:14	realbadhorse	Any of you people use ranger themes similar to this? http://dotshare.it/public/images/uploads/438.png
2020-08-09 21:09:17	lpyfist	isn't that just your terminal's theme
2020-08-09 21:10:05	realbadhorse	I mean the boxed style
2020-08-09 21:11:25	realbadhorse	each directly level is in its own box, instead of just having whitespace between them like the defauly
2020-08-09 21:11:46	realbadhorse	s/directly/directory/
2020-08-09 21:11:46	+cappuccino	realbadhorse meant to say: each directory level is in its own box, instead of just having whitespace between them like the defauly
2020-08-09 21:13:00	lpyfist	i'm pretty sure that is default behaviour
2020-08-09 21:14:19	lpyfist	it was for me, atleast. if not just read the ranger manpage.
2020-08-09 21:16:50	realbadhorse	just to be sure, we are talking about the same thing right? https://i.imgur.com/otN5IzR.png ; mine (default): https://i.imgur.com/A0V6zxl.png 
2020-08-09 21:18:23	lpyfist	is the second one how you want it
2020-08-09 21:19:05	realbadhorse	I want it like the first one
2020-08-09 21:19:10	lpyfist	oh lol
2020-08-09 21:19:45	lpyfist	just do set draw_borders true
2020-08-09 21:19:49	lpyfist	in your rc.conf
2020-08-09 21:19:53	realbadhorse	oh, thanks
2020-08-09 21:20:45	lpyfist	any time
2020-08-09 21:22:27	lpyfist	that aside, i actually prefer it this way: https://i.imgur.com/nMVDejV.png
2020-08-09 21:23:36	realbadhorse	Ive been using it that way for too long now, want to change things up
2020-08-09 21:24:05	lpyfist	ah, i see.

2020-08-09 21:52:49	realbadhorse	Except show dekstop, I should remove that
2020-08-09 21:53:13	+neeasade	the storage? temp?  memory usage? you are quite the environmental computer user
2020-08-09 21:53:28	realbadhorse	oh that
2020-08-09 21:53:39	realbadhorse	I probably could remove temp
2020-08-09 21:53:53	realbadhorse	I need storage since my main partition is just 400gb ssd

2020-08-09 22:02:11	realbadhorse	Looks amazing lpf 
2020-08-09 22:02:45	realbadhorse	how did you get polybar (I assume?) to show all windows on the workspace?
2020-08-09 22:05:01	lpf	well, that's actually awesomewm, which has a module for that. but coincidentally, i use polybar now and wrote a script that does that

2020-08-13 20:52:37	realbadhorse	i3 is probably the most famous and arguably the best support
2020-08-13 20:52:37	wakamiya	i know no lua and it was pretty self expalanatory to config
2020-08-13 20:52:40	realbadhorse	so I just use that
2020-08-13 20:53:17	realbadhorse	awesome is also pretty heavy but I probably dont get to complain about it since im on kde

2020-08-14 06:36:20	+icy	how much is their cheapest set
2020-08-14 06:36:30	+icy	yeah i'd imagine
2020-08-14 06:36:32	wakamiya	they dont sell like that
2020-08-14 06:36:41	wakamiya	people design a set, and lets say 500 sets are made
2020-08-14 06:36:45	+icy	auctions?
2020-08-14 06:36:45	+icy	oh ok
2020-08-14 06:36:47	wakamiya	you will have to find one on the aftermarket
2020-08-14 06:36:48	wakamiya	often for flip
2020-08-14 06:36:51	+icy	i see
2020-08-14 06:37:08	wakamiya	like when the order is made, a basekit might be 120 usd for example
2020-08-14 06:37:12	wakamiya	aftermarket will be 300+ lol
2020-08-14 06:37:21	+icy	hmmm
2020-08-14 06:37:39	wakamiya	dont bother
2020-08-14 06:37:41	+icy	i mean i'd say i'm 1 day into the whole mech scene

2020-08-14 06:38:03	wakamiya	hall effect alst infinitely, but so do a lot of other switches
2020-08-14 06:38:16	wakamiya	like various electro capacitive switches
2020-08-14 06:38:29	oxide	i see
2020-08-14 06:38:32	oxide	so why use anything else then
2020-08-14 06:38:38	wakamiya	compatibility
2020-08-14 06:38:41	wakamiya	also
2020-08-14 06:38:54	wakamiya	50 million or whatever cherrys old spec was is a meme

2020-08-14 06:41:29	wakamiya	ugh
2020-08-14 06:41:43	wakamiya	you sort of sell a lot of custom keyboards to afford others
2020-08-14 06:41:56	+icy	aahhh
2020-08-14 06:41:57	wakamiya	since the prices are insane these days 
2020-08-14 06:42:04	wakamiya	at leats I can't afford to have too many simultaneously
2020-08-14 06:42:06	+icy	and people don't mind using other's used boards
2020-08-14 06:42:08	+icy	?
2020-08-14 06:42:08	wakamiya	around 15 customs atm
2020-08-14 06:42:21	wakamiya	na people care for these better than for their own children if they have any
2020-08-14 06:42:29	+icy	wew bro
2020-08-14 06:42:31	+icy	lol
2020-08-14 06:42:33	wakamiya	one scratch would reduce the value so insanely much
2020-08-14 06:42:58	+icy	i don't think i'd ever want to type on a used board
2020-08-14 06:43:00	+icy	lol
2020-08-14 06:43:05	wakamiya	like a tiny scuff on the TGR Alice (the 5k one) would reduce the value by like 500-1k
2020-08-14 06:43:11	+icy	shi
2020-08-14 06:43:24	wakamiya	also when you buy a "board"
2020-08-14 06:43:29	wakamiya	you only buy the case most of the time
2020-08-14 06:43:34	+icy	oh?
2020-08-14 06:43:40	wakamiya	you still use your own pcbs, solder on own switches, own keycaps
2020-08-14 06:43:43	+icy	what about the pcb etc
2020-08-14 06:43:45	+icy	oh
2020-08-14 06:43:47	+icy	right
2020-08-14 06:43:51	wakamiya	well pcb is usually sold with the case
2020-08-14 06:44:00	+icy	okay hm
2020-08-14 06:44:03	wakamiya	if its a special one specific to the case

2020-08-14 06:46:55	+icy	r/mk has actually nice looking posts

2020-08-14 06:47:19	wakamiya	its shit
2020-08-14 06:47:28	+icy	or maybe ur just elitist :P
2020-08-14 06:47:54	wakamiya	no you get tired of seeing a cheap tray mount with pudding caps after a few years
2020-08-14 06:48:00	+icy	lol
2020-08-14 06:48:07	wakamiya	there is one elitist subreddit though where they ban these types of posts
2020-08-14 06:48:11	wakamiya	and only allow expensive customs
2020-08-14 06:48:12	wakamiya	thats elitist
2020-08-14 06:48:15	+icy	i mean, it might be someone's first custom build
2020-08-14 06:48:17	+icy	oh

2020-08-14 06:49:55	wakamiya	they just went for it
2020-08-14 06:50:54	+icy	i just read that myself ahaha
2020-08-14 06:51:04	+icy	i mean, yeah sure -- it makes sense
2020-08-14 06:51:13	+icy	r/unixart tried something similar i thijnk
2020-08-14 06:51:20	+icy	but it didn't quite take off

2020-08-14 06:54:19	wakamiya	when i started, 2k seemed like a lot for a keyboard
2020-08-14 06:54:22	wakamiya	and here we are
2020-08-14 06:54:35	wakamiya	basically its never a bad investment to get a custom keyboard
2020-08-14 06:54:39	wakamiya	in a group buy 
2020-08-14 06:54:45	wakamiya	youll always profit on it when selling it
2020-08-14 06:54:49	wakamiya	sometimes more than double
2020-08-14 06:55:14	wakamiya	i know people who quit their daytime job and just flip keyboard related shit

2020-08-14 07:05:58	wakamiya	so i tile the screen full and then switch to float and remove the unwanted windows

2020-08-15 11:54:58	@kori	er
2020-08-15 11:55:06	@kori	i think you're hiding too much information though
2020-08-15 11:55:07	wakamiya	solely because of your whining
2020-08-15 11:55:21	@kori	i'll take that as a compliment
2020-08-15 11:55:38	@kori	i want YOU to have the best desktop out there
2020-08-15 11:55:47	wakamiya	hiding too much info?
2020-08-15 11:55:51	wakamiya	are you talking about the bar
2020-08-15 11:55:59	@kori	the bar, irc
2020-08-15 11:56:05	@kori	both are kinda barren
2020-08-15 11:56:19	wakamiya	idk what to do about the bar yet, i deleted the tags because i never use them
2020-08-15 11:56:31	wakamiya	in a tilingwm idk who the fuck needs a tasklist in the bar
2020-08-15 11:57:07	wakamiya	as for weechat i didnt dive too deep into its config yet
2020-08-15 11:57:18	wakamiya	i dont really use irc that much, just this server and i barely even speak here lol
2020-08-15 11:57:28	wakamiya	just aesthetics for the occassional scrot
2020-08-15 11:57:49	@kori	well, you aren't tiling, you're floating
2020-08-15 11:57:53	@kori	so it might be useful to have it 
2020-08-15 11:58:12	@kori	after 8 years of ricing i can safely say: tiling is a gigantic meme
2020-08-15 11:58:19	@kori	it isn't actually useful anywhere
2020-08-15 11:58:30	@kori	it's better to fullscreen your applications and have multiple workspaces
2020-08-15 11:59:22	wakamiya	o since i switched to linux recently, i really prefer tiling
2020-08-15 11:59:33	wakamiya	maybe ill grow tired of it down the line but for everyday use and work related stuff, its great
2020-08-15 11:59:40	wakamiya	it might be a meme on a small laptop screen though
2020-08-15 12:00:20	wakamiya	i got 3 PG27Us, 4k 144hz screens

2020-08-15 12:05:17	realbadhorse	its just the general aesthetic which is hard to show in a screenshot

2020-08-15 12:11:18	realbadhorse	smooth fonts are easier on my eyes hence used in the terminal
2020-08-15 12:11:30	realbadhorse	bitmaps *look* nice hence in the bar and title
2020-08-15 12:11:38	wakamiya	this is some stoner music kori
2020-08-15 12:12:17	realbadhorse	I might switch out to gentoo soon
2020-08-15 12:12:19	realbadhorse	not sure

2020-08-15 12:16:44	realbadhorse	Btw do you guys prefer vmware over virtualbox?
2020-08-15 12:17:24	realbadhorse	been trying out vmware lately and its very weird. difficult to come to a conclusion
2020-08-15 12:17:43	realbadhorse	it integrates really well with windows/linux but the performance seems to take a hit
2020-08-15 12:18:01	realbadhorse	while vbox is... vbox
2020-08-15 12:18:36	realbadhorse	maybe vbox is best for my setup :\

2020-08-15 12:23:14	realbadhorse	virt-manager is just too janky
2020-08-15 12:23:42	realbadhorse	its good software but imo its nowhere close to vbox or vmware in terms of ease of use

2020-08-15 13:21:44	@kori	now im gonna grab the album cover, and im gonna see where the fuck this is, and im gonna try to get an even minimaler viable pattern

2020-08-15 13:23:25	@kori	realbadhorse: the album cover doesnt tile properly, right? I wanna see what I changed so I can re-do that in high resolution
2020-08-15 13:23:34	@kori	because I changed a lot of shit and the pattern I have is low resolution now 
2020-08-15 13:23:39	@kori	because I was trying to find the right crop
2020-08-15 13:23:45	@kori	turns out, there is no right crop
2020-08-15 13:23:49	@kori	and i moved some flowers around

2020-08-15 13:28:40	@kori	https://a.uguu.se/lvwvsm.png here, i have overlaid the pattern i got
2020-08-15 13:29:04	uoya	kori: it's a good song :) 
2020-08-15 13:29:11	 *	uoya is listening to Yes - Roundabout - 2003 Remaster from the album Fragile (Deluxe Edition).
2020-08-15 13:29:11	@kori	the album cover itself tiles vertically fine on its own, you can see that if i were to repeat my tile downwards it would match the actual album cover perfectly
2020-08-15 13:29:21	@kori	but the left and right sides don't match
2020-08-15 13:29:24	uoya	I've only just started watching JoJo, but I'm loving the end theme
2020-08-15 13:29:30	@kori	because there are flowers there that don't exist
2020-08-15 13:29:37	realbadhorse	i see the problem now kori 
2020-08-15 13:30:03	@kori	yeah
2020-08-15 13:30:13	realbadhorse	I might give it a shot later on
2020-08-15 13:30:35	@kori	so i need to remove the incomplete flowers from the album cover (if they were complete, I could just split them in some way they can be tiled)
2020-08-15 13:30:46	@kori	but considering they are incomplete, there are no pairs for them
2020-08-15 13:30:52	realbadhorse	youll probably have to crop out the border and place fipped crops on the other side of the image
2020-08-15 13:31:07	@kori	i then get all my complete flowers and lay them out in a way that it tiles
2020-08-15 13:31:13	realbadhorse	can you send the orig image
2020-08-15 13:31:15	@kori	on the sides, that is
2020-08-15 13:31:38	@kori	realbadhorse: https://a.uguu.se/nithht.jpg
2020-08-15 13:32:05	realbadhorse	thanks
2020-08-15 13:32:14	@kori	also im pretty sure that if I fix the tile i could probably get some place to make an actual cloth with this pattern
2020-08-15 13:32:17	realbadhorse	ill see if I can come up with something in some time
2020-08-15 13:32:18	@kori	so it's not just for ricing
2020-08-15 13:32:26	@kori	it could also be used for fashion
2020-08-15 13:32:37	@kori	very epic
2020-08-15 13:32:51	@kori	realbadhorse: cool lets see what you come up with
2020-08-15 13:32:57	realbadhorse	but first math homework awaits ;-;
2020-08-15 13:33:07	@kori	n-nice?
2020-08-15 13:35:08	uoya	I'd say we can help with your math homework but I suck at math
2020-08-15 13:36:34	wakamiya	kori out here designing garments
2020-08-15 13:38:41	@kori	more like remaking garments, im pretty sure this pattern comes from an actual cloth pattern in the first place
2020-08-15 13:40:12	 *	uoya is listening to Kevin Penkin - Tomorrow from the album MADE IN ABYSS Original Soundtrack.
2020-08-15 13:40:18	uoya	This soundtrack is so good
2020-08-15 13:40:26	uoya	I'm not even saying that because the composer is Australian either
2020-08-15 13:40:29	@kori	dude you know that one dude form toy story 2 that restores woody
2020-08-15 13:40:31	@kori	and lik
2020-08-15 13:40:34	@kori	paints his cheeks and shit
2020-08-15 13:40:37	@kori	the tiniest details?
2020-08-15 13:41:08	@kori	https://a.uguu.se/ewrwp.png look at the level of zoom im working with
2020-08-15 13:52:24	@kori	okay i did it
2020-08-15 13:57:46	realbadhorse	lol congrats
2020-08-15 13:57:59	@nil	i don't remember my age
2020-08-15 13:58:07	@nil	nvm
2020-08-15 14:13:40	uoya	you don't remember your age?

2020-08-15 14:14:02	uoya	I swear the bot used to tell you what your response time was
2020-08-15 14:14:58	luxemboye	icy: are you running Mastodon (incl. the database) entirely off the SD card?
2020-08-15 14:15:11	+icy	ya
2020-08-15 14:15:27	+icy	i prune it once a while
2020-08-15 14:16:29	-->	hyskaru (~hyskaru@fsociety.arcade) has joined #rice
2020-08-15 14:18:24	uoya	icy: oh, you're running a mastodon instance?
2020-08-15 14:18:47	uoya	I used to run one when they had their first initial release (out from under the radar) but my goodness was it a memory hog
2020-08-15 14:18:59	uoya	That said, I had no experience with Sidekiq/other Rails apps
2020-08-15 14:19:06	uoya	Now I just pay someone else to host my Mastodon instance
2020-08-15 14:19:13	uoya	And I've just started running my own Pleroma instance
2020-08-15 14:19:26	uoya	It's on DigitalOcean k8s 
2020-08-15 14:21:45	luxemboye	yeah, if you're gonna start a fedi instance, just go with Pleroma
2020-08-15 14:22:08	uoya	That said, if anyone wants to jump on my Pleroma instance, let me know :) 
2020-08-15 14:22:13	uoya	It's just me at the moment
2020-08-15 14:22:39	uoya	I've got a CDN setup for all media (including remote media), so it feels pretty snappy
2020-08-15 14:22:49	uoya	I've been thinking of adding Soapbox as a frontend
2020-08-15 14:23:04	uoya	https://soapbox.pub/
2020-08-15 14:23:05	+cappuccino	[ soapbox.pub ] Soapbox
2020-08-15 14:23:34	luxemboye	ehhh
2020-08-15 14:24:07	luxemboye	one thing that i've found somewhat annoying is how neckbeard handles the whole Object Storage remote media stuff
2020-08-15 14:24:44	uoya	luxemboye: neckbeard.xyz ?
2020-08-15 14:26:36	@kori	https://a.uguu.se/zhxmly.png
2020-08-15 14:26:41	@kori	should I unironically use this as a wallpaper?
2020-08-15 14:26:46	@kori	or does it clash with my terminals too much
2020-08-15 14:27:01	uoya	I actually kind of like it kori 
2020-08-15 14:27:03	@kori	actually i think its good
2020-08-15 14:27:10	@kori	nice
2020-08-15 14:27:13	@kori	cool cool thanks 
2020-08-15 14:27:14	uoya	It reminds me of Van Gogh for some reason
2020-08-15 14:27:26	uoya	Wow you've really got the tiling spot on!
2020-08-15 14:27:45	@kori	its not perfect still, uoya 
2020-08-15 14:27:58	@kori	i think i have an idea of how to fix it though
2020-08-15 14:28:00	@kori	so, sec
2020-08-15 14:28:00	uoya	I can't notice it
2020-08-15 14:28:04	+icy	uoya: yeah i run it off an rpi at home
2020-08-15 14:28:10	@kori	you will once i make the changes
2020-08-15 14:28:16	+icy	i think i'll switch to pleroma soon
2020-08-15 14:28:26	uoya	I'm super impressed you can get it running on a Pi
2020-08-15 14:28:37	uoya	Is it an raspberry pi 4 icy ?
2020-08-15 14:28:41	+icy	yep
2020-08-15 14:28:45	uoya	Oh nice
2020-08-15 14:28:52	uoya	I have one of those, I run a lightning/bitcoin node on it though
2020-08-15 14:33:34	luxemboye	uoya: yeah, SJW uses S3 bucket storage stuff, and when you're going through the hidden service it still makes a mix of "neckbeard.xyz" and "cheap" / "gay.negroes.forsale" (those are SJW's clearnet domains) requests.
2020-08-15 14:34:06	uoya	I'm surprised they're not running an onion proxy for those
2020-08-15 14:34:17	uoya	But I guess Pleroma doesn't really support Onion routing for media like that
2020-08-15 14:34:23	uoya	Well, not yet anyway
2020-08-15 14:34:48	uoya	The first issue I had with Pleroma was getting Postgres connections working with TLS, cause it's just broken out of the box. I've been meaning to make an upstream patch with my fix, maybe this weekend
2020-08-15 14:34:54	uoya	What's your handle btw? I'll follow you
2020-08-15 14:35:31	@kori	uoya: look
2020-08-15 14:35:38	@kori	im actually really proud that i noticed this
2020-08-15 14:35:47	@kori	so, #rice, i invite you to appreciate this as well
2020-08-15 14:36:04	@kori	https://a.uguu.se/lvnovi.png before changes
2020-08-15 14:36:09	@kori	https://a.uguu.se/ymcrv.png after changes
2020-08-15 14:36:36	uoya	I see a change in texture
2020-08-15 14:36:49	@kori	yeah, it tiles better now, i made the texture be more consistent
2020-08-15 14:36:58	@kori	you could clearly see the outline of where i had transplanted the flowers
2020-08-15 14:37:15	@kori	now, not so much, if at all
2020-08-15 14:37:20	uoya	icy: I'm really irked by those domain names associated with neckbeard.xyz, like raped.lol
2020-08-15 14:37:30	uoya	kori: nice one !
2020-08-15 14:37:38	 *	kori bows
2020-08-15 14:38:00	 *	uoya rapturous applause
2020-08-15 14:38:23	+icy	uoya: i mean, it's the internet lol
2020-08-15 14:38:37	@kori	it's the tiniest changes for the better im most proud of
2020-08-15 14:38:38	uoya	icy: yeah, I know, I'm just a sensitive human bean
2020-08-15 14:39:01	@kori	uoya: more like, you have some sense of decency
2020-08-15 14:39:30	luxemboye	and Soapbox has caused a ridicule amount of unnecessary arguing with the Pleroma dev people, including some trans folks that had done work at the beginning
2020-08-15 14:39:31	luxemboye	uoya: currently it's: @luxemboye@blob.cat
2020-08-15 14:39:33	luxemboye	i'm thinking about properly setting my own instance up in Luxembourg, but that's my current handle
2020-08-15 14:39:36	uoya	thanks, I like to think of it that way too kori 
2020-08-15 14:40:02	+icy	soapbox is great 
2020-08-15 14:40:20	+icy	i'm going to use it when i switch to pleroma
2020-08-15 14:40:37	uoya	It looks nice, I had a play around with it locally and wasn't super keen on the polish
2020-08-15 14:40:51	uoya	That said, I've really grown to like the Pleroma default frontend
2020-08-15 14:40:55	luxemboye	they were some hellthreads about it, but eh, i like PleromaFE
2020-08-15 14:41:31	uoya	I followed you luxemboye, please no dox
2020-08-15 14:42:11	uoya	I joined a federated relay on my Pleroma instance just after I'd setup a CDN

2020-08-15 14:43:04	luxemboye	and it's nice that pleroma still supports the mastodon frontend through glitch-soc
2020-08-15 14:43:11	+icy	uoya: what's your @
2020-08-15 14:43:11	uoya	Since then my cache hit ratio has dropped a _ton_, it was like 50%, now it's 20% lol
2020-08-15 14:43:26	uoya	Because I'm pre-fetching remote media so it doesn't take forever to reach me down in Australia

2020-08-15 14:48:15	uoya	Oh wow that must have been ages ago
2020-08-15 14:48:19	+icy	yeah! haha
2020-08-15 14:48:21	uoya	I barely even remember that iteration

2020-08-15 14:49:16	uoya	Hehe, I'm glad I managed to grab it when I did
2020-08-15 14:49:26	uoya	I also own two 2-letter .md domains

2020-08-15 14:49:46	+icy	oh wow
2020-08-15 14:49:53	+icy	handshake seemed a little uh, gimmicky
2020-08-15 14:49:56	uoya	If you have a GitHub account or public PGP keys (think Keybase.io) then you can claim about 800 USD worth of HNS
2020-08-15 14:49:59	+icy	with the whole blockshit meme
2020-08-15 14:50:05	uoya	So it's worth using it even if you're just immediately selling your coins for fiat
2020-08-15 14:50:26	+icy	yeah i don't really participate in crypto much
2020-08-15 14:50:54	+icy	and i only recently deleted my keybase (created it when they launched) -- they had a neat idea initially, but they kinda lost their vision 
2020-08-15 14:51:10	@kori	>kinda

2020-08-15 14:51:13	@kori	they sold out to fucking ZOOM

2020-08-15 15:12:41	uoya	That's my fork of parrot.live because the repo blew up

2020-08-15 15:12:50	+icy	nice 
2020-08-15 15:12:51	uoya	And I got self conscious adding stuff to it and dealing with PRs

2020-08-15 15:12:58	uoya	I just wanted somewhere where people could just easily add frames

2020-08-15 15:13:50	rbh	maybe I can efficiently waste the weekend installing gentoo
2020-08-15 15:14:01	rbh	not sure if ill do it on my main or serv

2020-08-15 15:14:05	+icy	i'm going to spend the weekend migrating to pleroma if possible
2020-08-15 15:14:11	+icy	using gleason's script
2020-08-15 15:14:13	uoya	icy: let me know if you have any issues :) 
2020-08-15 15:14:18	uoya	I'm running it in kubernetes/docker
2020-08-15 15:14:22	uoya	I built an image for it 
2020-08-15 15:14:25	+icy	oh oof -- i want to avoid that
2020-08-15 15:14:33	uoya	Mostly based off this: https://github.com/angristan/docker-pleroma

2020-08-15 15:14:38	rbh	oh wow thats pretty cool uoya 
2020-08-15 15:14:43	rbh	(soykaf)
2020-08-15 15:14:47	uoya	Although I've got it compiled 
2020-08-15 15:14:53	uoya	So it doesn't compile on start up, that was super annoying
2020-08-15 15:15:04	uoya	Not many people seem to realise you can make Elixir config load from the environment
2020-08-15 15:15:05	+icy	and uoya, i'm trying to migrate everything from mastodon -> pleroma. that includes my followers/following, posts, etc.
2020-08-15 15:15:06	uoya	rbh: thanks!
2020-08-15 15:15:15	+icy	rbh: do you have a fedi @?
2020-08-15 15:15:23	uoya	icy: ah, I haven't done that, I just started fresh (well, maintaining another instance, melb.social)
2020-08-15 15:15:24	luxemboye	using stanislas' image :)

2020-08-15 15:15:48	rbh	I dont but ive been meaning to get on mastandon
2020-08-15 15:15:52	rbh	it looks pretty cool
2020-08-15 15:15:55	+icy	mastodon
2020-08-15 15:15:55	rbh	let me do it right now
2020-08-15 15:16:01	+icy	mastodon is pretty shit tbh
2020-08-15 15:16:11	+icy	it's bloated
2020-08-15 15:16:11	rbh	isnt that what it is?
2020-08-15 15:16:16	rbh	what did you mean by fedi?
2020-08-15 15:16:16	+icy	fedi != mastodon
2020-08-15 15:16:25	+icy	mastodon is just one impl of the AP protocol
2020-08-15 15:16:44	+icy	i happen to run mastodon, so i can say with certainty that it sucks

2020-08-15 15:18:37	+icy	yeah i think it's a mastodon specific hack
2020-08-15 15:18:38	+icy	yes

2020-08-15 15:18:52	uoya	On my Pleroma instance you show up at toot.icyphox.sh
2020-08-15 15:18:56	+icy	yeah
2020-08-15 15:19:02	+icy	might be something only mastodon users see then

2020-08-15 15:19:36	rbh	hmm
2020-08-15 15:19:37	luxemboye	just like running an instance on "www.*"

2020-08-15 15:55:56	rbh	no 'repos' (i forget what they are called in gentoo land) are dedicated to serving bins right?
2020-08-15 15:56:08	rbh	bins for stuff from the main tree that is
2020-08-15 15:56:10	luxemboye	overlays?

2020-08-15 15:59:39	rbh	so back to my question, there are none of those right?
2020-08-15 15:59:47	rbh	or did I miss something the first time i gentoo'd
2020-08-15 15:59:52	+icy	no rbh that kinda defeats the purpose
2020-08-15 16:00:05	+icy	but i think you can just pull a bin off the offical website and it should run
2020-08-15 16:00:09	+icy	provided you're using glibc

2020-08-15 16:09:51	luxemboye	do you just cope with all of the packages updating that often?

2020-08-15 16:10:49	rbh	imo pacman is the best package manager for binary based stuff
2020-08-15 16:10:54	luxemboye	oof, well i guess that's a way of doing it
2020-08-15 16:11:03	+icy	your opinion is wrong then rbh

2020-08-15 16:11:55	luxemboye	at least you don't need --no-install-recommends to NOT install fonts and xorg stuff when installing a bash script (neofetch) on a headless server

2020-08-15 16:31:40	uoya	I wonder if it's intentional or their provider doing it
2020-08-15 16:31:45	uoya	luxemboye: lmao

2020-08-15 16:32:09	luxemboye	i get it for uploads
2020-08-15 16:32:18	luxemboye	but it's dumb to just block it entirely 
2020-08-15 16:34:28	uoya	Definitely makes sense for uploads
2020-08-15 16:34:37	uoya	Can you raise an issue?

2020-08-15 17:18:50	luxemboye	rbh: im way more comfortable with arch (pacman, etc.)
2020-08-15 17:18:52	luxemboye	I did try Nix, but the fact that it automatically uses lightdm is annoying, and nix-env stuff is somewhat slow on my VPS.
2020-08-15 17:18:54	luxemboye	I tried Gentoo, but compiling web engines/browsers takes too long, installing Steam is a pain, and I also needed Apache NetBeans, which isn't in the repos.
2020-08-15 17:18:59	luxemboye	(Same for Packet Tracer, but it's an external file, and while it's not hard to install, there's an AUR Makefile that makes it easier to manage)
2020-08-15 17:20:12	+oepsie	luxemboye, how coul that be.

2020-08-15 17:55:37	rbh	All you need is a backup of your /home and your pacman -Qe list

2020-08-15 17:58:43	luxemboye	or maybe not have stuff go down because it's a server :^)
2020-08-15 18:00:34	rbh	or just be like me and have a 40gb total install and just back up the entire fs x3

2020-08-15 20:36:29	rbh	what season?
2020-08-15 20:37:09	bochku	wakamiya, rbh I don't know why exactly picom is running slow for y'all, I'm guessing some nvidia driver issues. I used to have both transparency and blur on, and that didn't stress some 2010-grade dual core intel pentium cpu. btw I used tryone's fork of (then) compton
2020-08-15 20:37:20	rbh	nope, I just tested
2020-08-15 20:37:24	rbh	picom isnt causing the issue
2020-08-15 20:37:28	rbh	maybe its i3 itself?
2020-08-15 20:37:37	rbh	maybe its because its i3+kde?
2020-08-15 20:37:40	rbh	probably the latter

2020-08-16 12:14:33	luxemboye	i guess that's one way to do it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2020-08-16 12:14:35	luxemboye	i always have my irc client opened when im on a computer, so i usually get "notified"
2020-08-16 12:19:19	uoya	Yeah that's fair luxemboye

2020-08-16 12:21:09	realbadhorse	I was thinking something more along the lines of a weechat plugin that just makes a tiny dunst pop up uoya

2020-08-16 12:48:23	@kori	1. japanese characters being antialiased when you're using bitmap fonts is cringe, you need to fix that
2020-08-16 12:48:27	@kori	2. >Auschwitz
2020-08-16 12:48:49	@kori	3. same goes for the icons, you should probably try to use bitmap icons
2020-08-16 12:49:02	realbadhorse	excuse me kori, terminess is one of the best bitmaps
2020-08-16 12:49:06	@kori	i hate transparent terminals but it Kinda works here, I don't know why
2020-08-16 12:49:10	realbadhorse	objectively

2020-08-16 12:49:32	realbadhorse	my bad :P
2020-08-16 12:49:33	Juchi	is there a bitmap font woah
2020-08-16 12:49:41	@kori	Juchi: you could use GNU Unifont
2020-08-16 12:50:03	@kori	it has CJK characters that would fit your current font size
2020-08-16 12:50:06	@kori	just set that as the fallback
2020-08-16 12:50:12	Juchi	i'll try that
2020-08-16 12:50:18	Juchi	i meant bitmap icon fonts
2020-08-16 12:50:20	@kori	oh
2020-08-16 12:50:22	@kori	not sure
2020-08-16 12:50:27	@kori	siji has icons, but they're small

2020-08-16 13:08:21	realbadhorse	it worked for me the last time you used it..
2020-08-16 13:09:21	Juchi	it worked well, they were just japanese characters
2020-08-16 13:09:26	realbadhorse	ah i see
2020-08-16 13:09:52	realbadhorse	what are some nice jap fonts?
2020-08-16 13:09:57	realbadhorse	bitmaps or otherwise
2020-08-16 13:10:12	@kori	"or otherwise"
2020-08-16 13:10:15	@kori	its gotta match your setup, dawg

2020-08-16 13:11:52	@kori	realbadhorse: im using source han serif
2020-08-16 13:11:58	@kori	because triplicate is serify
2020-08-16 13:12:09	@kori	but i use ipafont when im using antialiased sans-serif fonts
2020-08-16 13:12:13	@kori	as for japanese
2020-08-16 13:12:24	@kori	i cant read japanese, so i pick the font that matches the size best
2020-08-16 13:12:34	realbadhorse	I see, thanks kori  Juchi 
2020-08-16 13:12:37	@kori	i meant "as for bitmap"

2020-08-16 13:12:52	@kori	if im using a normal bitmap font i use unifont
2020-08-16 13:13:30	@kori	for small bitmap korean characters, baekmuk gulim
2020-08-16 13:14:39	@kori	hope tghat helps

2020-08-16 13:24:24	@kori	also that doesn't look bad
2020-08-16 13:24:31	@kori	reminds me of nezumi's desktop (which I liked a lot)
2020-08-16 13:24:37	@kori	lemme upload it

2020-08-16 13:26:15	@kori	that was hardcore
2020-08-16 13:26:50	realbadhorse	did my internet just die?
2020-08-16 13:26:53	realbadhorse	hello..
2020-08-16 13:26:59	@kori	hello realbadhorse 
2020-08-16 13:27:08	realbadhorse	welp i guess chromium just died
2020-08-16 13:27:43	realbadhorse	oh I think its just the imagehost. does the link work for you?
2020-08-16 13:28:05	@kori	yes

2020-08-16 13:28:17	+cappuccino	dtops updated.
2020-08-16 13:28:20	@kori	that was just uploaded
2020-08-16 13:28:30	realbadhorse	oh it just loaded
2020-08-16 13:29:17	realbadhorse	I dont think I'd like to use that desktop lol kori 
2020-08-16 13:29:54	@kori	realbadhorse: i just think they look kinda similarish
2020-08-16 13:30:30	realbadhorse	I'd humbly disagree
2020-08-16 13:32:34	@cosarara	hehe that domain name
2020-08-16 13:33:27	@cosarara	realbadhorse: what's that top bar?
2020-08-16 13:35:23	realbadhorse	polybar cosarara 
2020-08-16 13:35:39	@cosarara	realbadhorse: is it easy to integrate with kwin?
2020-08-16 13:36:04	realbadhorse	I'm not sure, this is i3
2020-08-16 13:36:17	realbadhorse	it works really well with i3 after a couple of whitelisting rules
2020-08-16 13:36:33	realbadhorse	I can send you my config
2020-08-16 13:36:50	realbadhorse	Setting i3 as wm for KDE is as simple as setting an envvar
2020-08-16 13:37:25	@cosarara	but the bottom bar is plasma, right?
2020-08-16 13:37:32	realbadhorse	yep
2020-08-16 13:37:49	realbadhorse	I wouldve gotten rid of it if not for those really comfi plasma widgets
2020-08-16 13:37:57	realbadhorse	which dont show up on polybar's dock
2020-08-16 13:38:48	realbadhorse	media player integration for cmus, flameshot, networking, clipboard, app-specific audio control, mount control and more
2020-08-16 13:39:16	realbadhorse	no matter how ugly it looks I cant really get myself to remove it

2020-08-16 13:39:41	@cosarara	it's not that it's ugly, but that it doesn't match the rest of the setup
2020-08-16 13:43:30	realbadhorse	oh wait, did you look at the irc channel and figure it out? kori 
2020-08-16 13:43:54	realbadhorse	I was really confused when you said im on arch without me mentioning it (today)
2020-08-16 13:46:38	@cosarara	your screenshots realbadhorse have your user as arch@archlinux
2020-08-16 13:47:20	@cosarara	and a big arch logo on the *fetch
2020-08-16 13:47:34	Juchi	kori: how people get that minimal tab view on firefox like the image you sent https://a.uguu.se/vrsesn.png
2020-08-16 13:48:05	Juchi	is that a firefox fork or something
2020-08-16 13:49:02	realbadhorse	lol
2020-08-16 13:49:10	realbadhorse	that was before I sent those though
2020-08-16 13:49:16	@kori	realbadhorse: i actually saw the channel later on
2020-08-16 13:49:19	realbadhorse	probably.. maybe youre right :P
2020-08-16 13:49:26	luxemboye	fluxbox is such a pain jfc
2020-08-16 13:49:30	@kori	i inferred arch because only an arch user would use anything luke smith touched
2020-08-16 13:49:46	realbadhorse	ive given up on lesser known WMs
2020-08-16 13:49:48	@kori	Juchi: userchrome.css
2020-08-16 13:49:51	luxemboye	ehhh
2020-08-16 13:49:57	realbadhorse	i3 just works for me and configing is super simple
2020-08-16 13:50:15	@kori	awesome is the greatest window manager of all time
2020-08-16 13:50:16	@kori	of ALL TIME
2020-08-16 13:50:20	luxemboye	luke smith has recently gone somewhat crazy, but i don't understand all the hate against him
2020-08-16 13:50:26	 *	kori gives mic back to taylor swift
2020-08-16 13:50:31	@kori	luxemboye: I don't hate him
2020-08-16 13:50:41	@kori	i actually didn't even know he existed for a long time
2020-08-16 13:50:50	@kori	but i think larbs is fucking cringe
2020-08-16 13:51:15	luxemboye	yeah i agree about larbs, that's pretty dumb
2020-08-16 13:51:40	luxemboye	but otherwise he's not that bad, and promotes linux stuff
2020-08-16 13:52:05	luxemboye	as well as decentralization and federation
2020-08-16 13:52:10	@kori	i also dont know how the fuck he has 100k subscribers
2020-08-16 13:52:29	wakamiya	are there any good linuxtubers
2020-08-16 13:52:39	realbadhorse	I used to watch him when I was new to linux to discover cool and hip cli programs
2020-08-16 13:52:39	luxemboye	ehhh
2020-08-16 13:52:46	wakamiya	luke seems mentally ill and distrotube looks mentally ill
2020-08-16 13:52:48	@kori	realbadhorse: wanna know how i know you're new?
2020-08-16 13:52:54	@kori	:^)

2020-08-16 13:53:07	luxemboye	I never found DT's content interesting
2020-08-16 13:53:07	@kori	i didn't because when i created this channel luke smith wasn't a thing

2020-08-16 14:48:27	wakamiya	kori plz
2020-08-16 14:48:28	@cosarara	at first I did new email addresses too
2020-08-16 14:48:31	@cosarara	but then I got lazy
2020-08-16 14:48:44	@cosarara	I mean, in the end it's the same ip address everywhere
2020-08-16 14:48:47	wakamiya	kori you gott a climb
2020-08-16 14:48:52	@kori	wakamiya: that's because you can't invite users from a public forum
2020-08-16 14:49:01	@kori	cosarara: i use a different name on oppaitime
2020-08-16 14:49:03	@kori	because
2020-08-16 14:49:05	@kori	well
2020-08-16 14:49:07	@kori	it's oppaitime
2020-08-16 14:49:20	@cosarara	uploading is a pain wakamiya 
2020-08-16 14:49:43	wakamiya	no
2020-08-16 14:49:44	@kori	there i hid my snatched torrents
2020-08-16 14:49:49	@kori	phew that was close
2020-08-16 14:49:51	wakamiya	on AB it's only 100 uploads for TM right?
2020-08-16 14:50:08	wakamiya	I did it, saw that the TM forums sucked, then let my uploads be pruned
2020-08-16 14:50:11	wakamiya	i'm only elite now
2020-08-16 14:50:14	wakamiya	on AB that is
2020-08-16 14:50:32	@cosarara	where did you get your things to upload?
2020-08-16 14:50:34	wakamiya	well I lost TM on most places, when you have everything you just stop caring as much
2020-08-16 14:50:44	wakamiya	lol 3/4 uploads per release
2020-08-16 14:50:49	wakamiya	just uploaded weeb music that wasn't on there
2020-08-16 14:51:00	@cosarara	i c
2020-08-16 14:51:01	wakamiya	transcoded lossless to 320 and v0
2020-08-16 14:51:08	@cosarara	music is easy
2020-08-16 14:51:09	wakamiya	if it had a 24bit ver, that was 4
2020-08-16 14:51:16	wakamiya	you can automate that shit
2020-08-16 14:51:18	wakamiya	like i did on RED
2020-08-16 14:51:28	@cosarara	I had a script for wcd
2020-08-16 14:51:34	@kori	RED is the only tracker i care about tbh
2020-08-16 14:51:36	lpf	send animebytes
2020-08-16 14:51:46	wakamiya	i only care about ptp and btn atm
2020-08-16 14:51:51	@kori	tfw no btn
2020-08-16 14:51:53	lpf	RED is the only tracker that i'm on that i don't care about
2020-08-16 14:51:59	wakamiya	AB isn't too necessary since nyaa.si has most shit anyway unless you want to watch old shit
2020-08-16 14:52:00	lpf	i only listen to weeb music
2020-08-16 14:52:03	@kori	well i guess ptp too
2020-08-16 14:52:05	lpf	h4h4h4h4
2020-08-16 14:52:09	@kori	lpf: epic win
2020-08-16 14:52:18	wakamiya	AB has so many random ass fansubs i never heard of
2020-08-16 14:52:23	@cosarara	PTP is the one that would hurt me the most to lose
2020-08-16 14:52:24	wakamiya	fansubbing is dead huh
2020-08-16 14:52:35	lpf	i only download from animebytes now, i rarely look at bakabt and never nyaa
2020-08-16 14:52:53	wakamiya	i get seasonal anime on nyaa
2020-08-16 14:53:04	@kori	i kinda hate anime
2020-08-16 14:53:05	wakamiya	because im too lazy to reseed episodes for a week that are about to be pruned anyway on AB
2020-08-16 14:53:08	@kori	not because i hate anime
2020-08-16 14:53:15	wakamiya	now hear this
2020-08-16 14:53:19	@kori	i very rarely have the patience to sit through something now
2020-08-16 14:53:27	@kori	but when i do it's all in one go
2020-08-16 14:53:27	wakamiya	both BTN and PTP i invited 2 real life friends, both let their accounts die without downloading a byte
2020-08-16 14:53:30	wakamiya	never inviting anyone again
2020-08-16 14:53:34	@kori	like,f or example, i finished the good place in one session
2020-08-16 14:53:37	@kori	its 4 seasons
2020-08-16 14:53:39	@kori	kinda wild
2020-08-16 14:53:56	@kori	>BTN account died
2020-08-16 14:53:58	@kori	oh my god
2020-08-16 14:54:02	@kori	getting a btn account is so hard
2020-08-16 14:54:03	wakamiya	wanna know what's funny
2020-08-16 14:54:04	@kori	i want one 
2020-08-16 14:54:08	@kori	how the fuck can they just let it die
2020-08-16 14:54:10	@cosarara	do tell wakamiya 
2020-08-16 14:54:13	wakamiya	I had BTN in like 2013, let my account die cause i wasnt into torrenting
2020-08-16 14:54:17	@cosarara	kori: IRL people wouldn't know the value
2020-08-16 14:54:21	wakamiya	few years back i hit up their IRC when i found out about private trackers
2020-08-16 14:54:24	wakamiya	they re-enabled it
2020-08-16 14:54:32	@kori	BTN is probably the mjost hardcorest shit ever 
2020-08-16 14:54:32	wakamiya	after years of inactivity
2020-08-16 14:54:46	@kori	theres so many old shows i wanna get that i cant find anywhere
2020-08-16 14:54:57	wakamiya	like
2020-08-16 14:55:02	@kori	a friend downloaded me black hole high a while back
2020-08-16 14:55:04	wakamiya	acquiring an invite to hand out on BTN is a PITA
2020-08-16 14:55:09	wakamiya	it takes years to get ONE
2020-08-16 14:55:13	wakamiya	and these fuckers let their accs die
2020-08-16 14:55:14	wakamiya	lol
2020-08-16 14:55:23	@cosarara	isn't the population dying then?
2020-08-16 14:55:29	wakamiya	no
2020-08-16 14:55:33	wakamiya	lemme check
2020-08-16 14:55:34	@cosarara	how many active accounts does it have by now?
2020-08-16 14:56:04	wakamiya	over their limit
2020-08-16 14:56:14	wakamiya	active this month about 75%
2020-08-16 14:56:16	lpf	>isn't the population dying
2020-08-16 14:56:17	wakamiya	of the user base
2020-08-16 14:56:22	lpf	invites are not the only way to get in
2020-08-16 14:56:26	lpf	you can get recruited
2020-08-16 14:56:30	wakamiya	what
2020-08-16 14:56:33	wakamiya	btn doesn't recruit
2020-08-16 14:56:36	lpf	oh ok
2020-08-16 14:56:42	wakamiya	and hasn't for al ong fucking time
2020-08-16 14:56:43	wakamiya	afaik
2020-08-16 14:56:57	lpf	fun fact i joined animebytes by applying
2020-08-16 14:57:01	@cosarara	same
2020-08-16 14:57:01	+cappuccino	same
2020-08-16 14:57:07	@cosarara	no cappy you didn't
2020-08-16 14:57:09	wakamiya	i got in through RED
2020-08-16 14:57:12	lpf	and my application literally said
2020-08-16 14:57:22	lpf	'i'm not gonna use the tracker but i heard the forums are good'
2020-08-16 14:57:27	@cosarara	lmao
2020-08-16 14:57:30	wakamiya	yikes
2020-08-16 14:57:34	wakamiya	AB isn't hard to get into tho
2020-08-16 14:57:50	@cosarara	bibliotik was a bit of a pain
2020-08-16 14:57:50	wakamiya	RED made private trackers ezmode
2020-08-16 14:58:02	@cosarara	i got in through what.cd
2020-08-16 14:58:12	@kori	i miss what
2020-08-16 14:58:15	wakamiya	i wasn't around for wcd :<
2020-08-16 14:58:19	@cosarara	kori: who doesn't
2020-08-16 14:58:20	lpf	i didn't mean i applied through recruitment threads
2020-08-16 14:58:25	lpf	i meant i applied directly on the site
2020-08-16 14:58:28	@kori	cosarara: red is a worthy replacement though
2020-08-16 14:58:30	wakamiya	didn't RED surpass wcd by now tho?
2020-08-16 14:58:33	wakamiya	content wise
2020-08-16 14:58:35	@kori	wakamiya: probably not
2020-08-16 14:58:42	@kori	well
2020-08-16 14:58:44	@kori	maybe
2020-08-16 14:58:51	@kori	afaik there's still a bunch of shit that hasnt been reuploaded
2020-08-16 14:58:56	@cosarara	most likely not
2020-08-16 14:59:09	wakamiya	i've had ridiculous requests and they've all been filled on RED
2020-08-16 14:59:15	wakamiya	like some osbcure bootleg vinyl single
2020-08-16 14:59:29	wakamiya	people were desperate at that tiem and did anythiung for buffer
2020-08-16 14:59:32	wakamiya	idk how they found a copy
2020-08-16 14:59:40	@kori	Magic
2020-08-16 15:00:02	wakamiya	you can brag when you're on a certain magic tracker
2020-08-16 15:00:30	@cosarara	lol I have a request option from 1 year ago
2020-08-16 15:00:33	@cosarara	just checked
2020-08-16 15:00:40	@cosarara	maybe the bounty is just too low
2020-08-16 15:00:58	@cosarara	it was for a friend tho so I don't really care
2020-08-16 15:01:11	wakamiya	on RED i was generous
2020-08-16 15:01:20	wakamiya	lemme check
2020-08-16 15:01:56	@cosarara	I had a 4GB and a 5GB filled, this one is 1.52GB
2020-08-16 15:01:59	wakamiya	Requests voted: 10 for 1.758 TB
2020-08-16 15:02:13	wakamiya	Requests created: 9 for 1.757 TB
2020-08-16 15:02:33	@cosarara	is this your full time job?
2020-08-16 15:02:44	wakamiya	huh
2020-08-16 15:03:07	wakamiya	what did he mean by this
2020-08-16 15:03:27	lpf	.dtop zanthas
2020-08-16 15:03:27	+cappuccino	zanthas has no dtops.
2020-08-16 15:04:04	lpf	.seen st4g
2020-08-16 15:04:04	+cappuccino	I haven't seen any activity from st4g yet.
2020-08-16 15:04:15	@cosarara	wakamiya: I mean you have very big numbers, so you must spend lots of time downloading things to get your buffers up
2020-08-16 15:04:17	lpf	huh stag is active on ab
2020-08-16 15:04:35	wakamiya	i spent like 10 minutes setting up autosnatching and 5 minutes renting a host for it
2020-08-16 15:04:41	@cosarara	hm 3 login attemps this week on my account
2020-08-16 15:04:59	wakamiya	so yeah, fulltime job lol
2020-08-16 15:05:12	@cosarara	you autosnatch all the freeleech or...?
2020-08-16 15:05:18	wakamiya	theres no freeleech on red
2020-08-16 15:05:29	@kori	there is
2020-08-16 15:05:32	wakamiya	o?
2020-08-16 15:05:38	wakamiya	is there lol
2020-08-16 15:05:49	@cosarara	maybe not always?
2020-08-16 15:05:52	wakamiya	i know of freeleech tokens but thats it
2020-08-16 15:05:59	wakamiya	back in the day there werent tokens though
2020-08-16 15:06:03	@cosarara	I'm certain there has been freeleech picks
2020-08-16 15:06:16	wakamiya	i dont remember but no
2020-08-16 15:06:23	wakamiya	i autosnatched every release of a particular year, the current year
2020-08-16 15:06:28	wakamiya	so did a lot of other autosnatchers
2020-08-16 15:06:37	wakamiya	so we basically inflated our own buffers within that circlejerk
2020-08-16 15:06:47	@kori	there were like so many freeleech tokens that i literally had 80 left when they ran out
2020-08-16 15:07:03	@kori	and i downloaded everything i could think of and a lot of things i didnt think of
2020-08-16 15:07:13	wakamiya	hoarding is bad
2020-08-16 15:07:23	wakamiya	every download i manually did was something i legitimately wanted to listen to
2020-08-16 15:07:28	wakamiya	same goes for btn and ptp
2020-08-16 15:07:39	wakamiya	buffer is so easy that theres no need for me to get random shit
2020-08-16 15:07:52	wakamiya	btn is freeleech as it is tho
2020-08-16 15:07:57	wakamiya	but PTP is very generous with points
2020-08-16 15:09:00	@cosarara	I haven't had ratio problems since wcd
2020-08-16 15:10:03	lpf	kori do you remember haruneko
2020-08-16 15:10:11	lpf	i sent him a message on jpopsuki but he didn't respond
2020-08-16 15:10:13	lpf	sad
2020-08-16 15:10:30	@kori	yes
2020-08-16 15:13:20	@cosarara	kori, lpf added you
2020-08-16 15:13:23	@cosarara	on AB
2020-08-16 15:16:37	<--	dimonov (dimonov@Rizon-8A1C10A2.insomnia247.nl) has left #rice (WeeChat 2.3)
2020-08-16 15:16:45	@cosarara	wakamiya: why is hoarding bad?
2020-08-16 15:17:25	@cosarara	because you don't let others get their upload buffers up?
2020-08-16 15:17:57	@kori	cosarara: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yes?
2020-08-16 15:18:13	@kori	someone else did too
2020-08-16 15:18:15	@kori	whomst
2020-08-16 15:18:26	lpf	no he meant
2020-08-16 15:18:35	lpf	'kori, lpf, i added you both'
2020-08-16 15:18:49	lpf	not, 'kori, i noticed that lpf has added you'
2020-08-16 15:19:01	@kori	oh ok
2020-08-16 15:19:06	@kori	you forgot yr :
2020-08-16 15:19:18	@cosarara	yes
2020-08-16 15:19:39	@cosarara	mb, can't communicate
2020-08-16 15:20:08	wakamiya	cosarara: what's the point of it
2020-08-16 15:20:25	wakamiya	what's the point of having a lot of media stored that you'll never get to watch/listen to?
2020-08-16 15:20:27	@cosarara	It keeps things well seeded
2020-08-16 15:20:34	@cosarara	For others who do need them
2020-08-16 15:20:38	lpf	only if you actually seed long time
2020-08-16 15:20:43	wakamiya	sure in that case
2020-08-16 15:20:48	wakamiya	if you're a good samaritan
2020-08-16 15:20:50	lpf	there is no shortage of short term seeding
2020-08-16 15:21:08	@cosarara	What kind of hoarder deletes things tho?
2020-08-16 15:21:21	@cosarara	That's not hoarding then
2020-08-16 15:21:26	wakamiya	the kind that realizes life isn't centered around trackers and hard drives
2020-08-16 15:21:30	wakamiya	and moves on
2020-08-16 15:21:39	@cosarara	Lol
2020-08-16 15:21:48	@cosarara	Wait, it isn't?
2020-08-16 15:21:50	lpf	if you legitimately seed a long time then you're doing good lad
2020-08-16 15:22:08	@cosarara	I seed forever
2020-08-16 15:22:26	@cosarara	well rather
2020-08-16 15:22:31	lpf	my own disk space is very limited
2020-08-16 15:22:35	@cosarara	I seed until it's inevitably trumped lol
2020-08-16 15:22:49	wakamiya	you'll grow up one day
2020-08-16 15:22:52	wakamiya	don't worry
2020-08-16 15:22:54	lpf	i have 3tb on remote servers which serves as my current 'seed as long as possible' cache
2020-08-16 15:22:55	wakamiya	I was like that too for a year or 2
2020-08-16 15:23:08	@cosarara	"one of the torrents you are seeding was deleted"
2020-08-16 15:23:14	lpf	and everything is temporary on my local computes
2020-08-16 15:23:15	@cosarara	most common message
2020-08-16 15:23:29	wakamiya	i just check everything red flagged on rutorrent once every few months and delete that
2020-08-16 15:23:43	@cosarara	red flagged?
2020-08-16 15:23:54	wakamiya	with status warnings
2020-08-16 15:24:05	wakamiya	which means it has been deleted, unless the tracker is down
2020-08-16 15:24:25	@cosarara	ah
2020-08-16 15:24:28	wakamiya	i don't manually delete every time i get a message X has been deleted lol
2020-08-16 15:24:32	wakamiya	just bulk it once every few months
2020-08-16 15:24:33	@cosarara	I usually delete the torrent but keep the content then
2020-08-16 15:24:48	@cosarara	or actually, pause the torrent
2020-08-16 15:26:14	wakamiya	then that brings me back to the question
2020-08-16 15:26:15	wakamiya	why hoard
2020-08-16 15:26:24	wakamiya	content you wont watch or listen to
2020-08-16 15:26:26	wakamiya	and not seed
2020-08-16 15:28:06	@cosarara	well I usually assume that if you hoard, you seed. Hoarding stuff you don't want and then not seeding it is the worst waste of energy imaginable
2020-08-16 15:28:17	wakamiya	you said you do exactly that? no?
2020-08-16 15:28:26	@cosarara	I download only things I like
2020-08-16 15:28:46	@cosarara	or things I think I might like
2020-08-16 15:28:55	wakamiya	o
2020-08-16 15:28:55	wakamiya	ok
2020-08-16 15:29:12	@cosarara	but if the torrent is deleted from the tracker and I can't seed anymore then what can I do? lol
2020-08-16 15:29:46	@cosarara	and well, to be fair I will probably never rewatch most shows, so I could delete them

2020-08-16 16:22:16	@kori	but the discussions of economics boil down to "how do we allocate resources"
2020-08-16 16:23:32	lpf	how do you make state as efficient as walmart?

2020-08-16 16:35:14	lpf	it's your prerogative to interpret that as you will, but i think it could be demonstrated that idpol shot up when occupy started
2020-08-16 16:36:02	lpf	almost everything stems from economic hardship but our benevolent leaders would rather focus on the symptoms
2020-08-16 16:36:27	@kori	i am very skeptical of ``idpol'' but it's disingenuous to try and untangle race and class in America

2020-08-16 20:27:37	wakamiya	the thing with violin is that it's the worlds most difficult instrument, and some pieces don't sound all too complex but use techniques only virtuoso violinists can utilize properly

2020-08-17 02:40:37	@mitya	that's better
2020-08-17 02:41:01	@mitya	tfw I know Latin better than Spanish
2020-08-17 02:44:13	@cosarara	días is masculine, so buenos
2020-08-17 02:44:47	@mitya	I had a feeling that was the case
2020-08-17 02:44:52	@mitya	but the a throws me off
2020-08-17 02:45:00	@mitya	feminine things in Latin never have an a like that
2020-08-17 02:45:11	@mitya	genders in Spanish are much less predictable
2020-08-17 02:45:41	@cosarara	they tend to match though
2020-08-17 02:45:49	@cosarara	so like given a noun, if you know the latin root
2020-08-17 02:45:53	@cosarara	the gender should be the same
2020-08-17 02:46:03	@mitya	yeah, when I know words from Latin that works
2020-08-17 02:46:12	@mitya	but there are a ton of really different words between the two
2020-08-17 02:46:21	@mitya	some are easy though
2020-08-17 02:46:28	@mitya	e.g. calidum to caliente

2020-08-17 04:17:28	realbadhorse	how do you like Go Acbn?
2020-08-17 04:17:34	Acbn	I love it
2020-08-17 04:17:45	Acbn	left my C++ job for a chance to start using Go fulltime
2020-08-17 04:17:47	realbadhorse	I tried it some time ago fire a very tiny project but I've yet to go back for it
2020-08-17 04:18:01	realbadhorse	not for the lack of interest but just due to my procastination
2020-08-17 04:18:27	realbadhorse	for*
2020-08-17 04:18:29	Acbn	was it server-side?
2020-08-17 04:18:49	Acbn	I wouldn't suggest it that much for client-side stuff, but I'm writing the client side of a tool right now in it
2020-08-17 04:18:52	Acbn	pretty painful, though
2020-08-17 04:18:57	uoya	Go is quite nice
2020-08-17 04:19:06	realbadhorse	something like that, very small though. a very small ~200 line program
2020-08-17 04:19:10	uoya	It's verbose though
2020-08-17 04:19:14	Acbn	if you can find the libraries you need for cross platform stuff client side, then it's easy for sure, but if you're doing something syscall intensive it's gonna suck
2020-08-17 04:19:25	realbadhorse	Yea client side was a bit painful
2020-08-17 04:19:29	Acbn	idk, compared to C++ this is very nice to use
2020-08-17 04:19:56	Acbn	@ uoya, not rbh
2020-08-17 04:20:12	uoya	I'd agree with that compared to C++

2020-08-17 13:18:37	bochku	also Aeres why does the blur seem pixelated?
2020-08-17 13:18:44	+icy	bochku: sf mono
2020-08-17 13:18:53	+icy	the best font
2020-08-17 13:19:11	Aeres	bochku: don't know. seems pretty alright to me
2020-08-17 13:19:18	bochku	icy: does it have ligature support?
2020-08-17 13:19:24	Aeres	it can be the issue with picom, it has been weird lately. 
2020-08-17 13:19:24	+icy	mine does, yes
2020-08-17 13:19:40	+icy	bochku: you can patch in ligs for basically any font now
2020-08-17 13:19:42	bochku	icy: awesome
2020-08-17 13:20:02	bochku	am I seeing things then? the blurring definitely seemed boxy
2020-08-17 13:20:41	Aeres	it is. 
2020-08-17 13:21:09	Aeres	so far its not very distracting.
2020-08-17 13:23:02	bochku	icy can you send me the files for your font? sf mono is amazing, but I'll die without ligatures

2020-08-17 13:45:59	uoya	But everything else is dead
2020-08-17 13:46:10	luxemboye	i was gonna ask, aren't most dead?
2020-08-17 13:46:11	uoya	I feel like there's room for a similar format but with some nicer additions
2020-08-17 13:46:26	+icy	100%
2020-08-17 13:46:28	uoya	Like doing everything over websockets for instant loading

2020-08-17 13:46:37	uoya	Using a faster CDN (although 4chan is good)
2020-08-17 13:46:43	uoya	I'm kind of tempted to do it for fun
2020-08-17 13:46:49	uoya	In something like Rust or Elixir
2020-08-17 13:46:53	luxemboye	like even 8kun nowadays is somewhat slow (at least the boards i looked at)

2020-08-17 13:51:04	luxemboye	solution: don't go anywhere near it, but complain about it :^)
2020-08-17 13:51:45	uoya	can someone ping me 
2020-08-17 13:51:54	uoya	I just changed notifs to come via iTerm instead of Terminal

2020-08-17 13:53:54	+icy	i don't think i'll ever bother learning a new language
2020-08-17 13:55:03	uoya	icy: what's your go to language these days?
2020-08-17 13:55:13	uoya	Elixir is amazing because it makes you think about things differently
2020-08-17 13:55:28	uoya	Gives you more tools to work with out of the box, like GenServers, which are a fantastic approach to distributed computing
2020-08-17 13:56:12	+icy	uoya: it depends. i hardly ever write code. work is mostly just infra. 
2020-08-17 13:56:22	+icy	but if i need something quick, it's python
2020-08-17 13:56:23	uoya	oh fair enough
2020-08-17 13:56:26	uoya	are you doing devops?
2020-08-17 13:56:29	uoya	Golang is great for infra
2020-08-17 13:56:40	uoya	E.g. Terraform providers
2020-08-17 13:56:57	+icy	yeah devops / platform engg the likes
2020-08-17 13:57:07	+icy	i really enjoy writing nim though uoya 
2020-08-17 13:57:16	uoya	oooh I've been meaning to get into nim
2020-08-17 13:57:19	uoya	I just haven't found the time
2020-08-17 13:57:24	uoya	That would be edgy enough for an image board
2020-08-17 13:57:28	+icy	familiarity of python and the speed of C
2020-08-17 13:57:30	uoya	Backend in Elixir, frontend in Nim
2020-08-17 13:57:32	uoya	Can you imagine
2020-08-17 13:57:34	+icy	haha
2020-08-17 13:57:37	+icy	that'll be epic
2020-08-17 13:57:44	+icy	you can write both in Nim too

2020-08-17 14:05:07	bochku	ok I'm tired of colorzied_lines.pl... can't do so much
2020-08-17 14:06:44	uoya	bochku: did you get it looking okay?
2020-08-17 14:07:04	uoya	I just realised it's totally doable to run a process for each imageboard thread
2020-08-17 14:07:08	uoya	All in memory
2020-08-17 14:07:27	uoya	Then if you cluster the application you can handle failover of a single node going down
2020-08-17 14:07:27	bochku	uoya: yeah it's actually possible to get it looking really nice
2020-08-17 14:07:38	uoya	But also literally not store any posts anywhere
2020-08-17 14:07:50	uoya	That'd be interesting. You'd need to store media somewhere other than memory though

2020-08-17 21:22:38	@kori	no one has EVER DONE THIS in the HISTORY OF RICING
2020-08-17 21:22:41	realbadhorse	well so turns out funtoo has a dedicated overlay for binary packages
2020-08-17 21:22:43	+neeasade	EVER
2020-08-17 21:23:03	realbadhorse	which was (partially) the reason I did not use gentoo
2020-08-17 21:23:12	realbadhorse	but that seems to be solved by funtoo
2020-08-17 21:23:27	+neeasade	realbadhorse: til
2020-08-17 21:23:27	realbadhorse	was wondering if funtoo overlays work well with gentoo
2020-08-17 21:23:48	realbadhorse	of if there are more advantages to using fun2 over gen2
2020-08-17 21:23:54	realbadhorse	or if*
2020-08-17 21:24:31	realbadhorse	since id rather go for a rather famous distro like gentoo with ~1k irc members than funtoo which doesnt seem to have a channel at all
2020-08-17 21:24:33	@kori	realbadhorse: install exherbo and lets figure it out together
2020-08-17 21:24:44	@kori	i love getting groups of people to install a niche distro and make some cool shit
2020-08-17 21:25:06	@kori	inb4 6c37 revival with exherbo repositories
2020-08-17 21:25:11	realbadhorse	i will never fall into the niche meme after what I went through with void
2020-08-17 21:25:21	wakamiya	arch4lyfe why complicate things
2020-08-17 21:25:28	@kori	also to answer your question i have no clue 
2020-08-17 21:25:28	realbadhorse	and even that was one of the good niche distros
2020-08-17 21:25:41	@kori	there was a time when using funtoo had slightly more uhhhhhh
2020-08-17 21:25:45	realbadhorse	so what broke on arch today you ask?
2020-08-17 21:25:48	@kori	they had some helper scripts that gentoo didn't have
2020-08-17 21:25:51	@kori	now gentoo caught up
2020-08-17 21:25:53	@kori	so
2020-08-17 21:26:04	@kori	gentoo is actually a viable distro to install and i was gonna install it
2020-08-17 21:26:14	@kori	but then i booted up systemrescuecd and decided to go for exherbo instead
2020-08-17 21:26:14	realbadhorse	it was vmware kernel module because it doesnt support such a new linux kernel version
2020-08-17 21:26:31	wakamiya	i was considering gentoo as my first distro instead of arch but then the wiki said it takes up to two weeks to install
2020-08-17 21:26:33	realbadhorse	so I had to roll back to linux-lts
2020-08-17 21:26:37	realbadhorse	which in turn broke my grub
2020-08-17 21:26:43	realbadhorse	which I spent 40minutes debugging

2020-08-18 20:55:31	+dysfigured	i've crammed so much shit into my prompt (that hides itself when irrelevant) and it still fits into one line

2020-08-18 21:18:13	+dysfigured	cosarara: imo react is perfect fit for this, would allow real-time feeds of comments/votes/uploads/etc, without duplicating server side templating as well as client-side
2020-08-18 21:20:05	+dysfigured	projektile: btw i have a script that wraps up slop with maim and ffmpeg for screenshots and screen recordings

2020-08-18 21:26:01	projektile	ok ooh very involved
2020-08-18 21:26:55	+dysfigured	imo the best part is what you can do with the callbacks, i have mine set to process files a few different ways, pngs get compressed with optipng, then i get a zenity prompt to preview/upload/delete
2020-08-18 21:28:38	+dysfigured	i bind png capture to prtsc, super+prtsc will use slop to pick a window/selection, adding shift will record a webm instead
2020-08-18 21:30:38	+dysfigured	but i wouldn't say it's too involved. it's basically the same usage as scrot, but using slop and maim instead
2020-08-18 21:31:09	projektile	300 lines for something that can be done as a one liner is involved. 
2020-08-18 21:33:25	@Leliana	how the fuck can you do that in one line?

2020-08-18 21:35:34	projektile	Leliana, i was specifically referring to "maim tile.png --hidecursor --geometry=$(slop)" the one liner that started the conversation

2020-08-21 11:38:40	@Leliana	they're pretty much just premade .config files that you then adjust to your needs
2020-08-21 11:39:33	@Leliana	usually they're configured for openrc, thus making them worthless :^)
2020-08-21 11:39:47	+onodera	I found the wiki page, however I can't find the seeds online anywhere
2020-08-21 11:39:59	+onodera	like im not using gentoo, but I want to check out some good dekstop config examples

2020-08-21 11:44:19	+onodera	the thing with muqss is that it's slow to update
2020-08-21 11:44:46	+onodera	and recently CK wrote some blogpost about the kernel getting bigger and him needing to do more work every release
2020-08-21 11:45:17	+onodera	from what I understand this cachy thing is more a hack on top of CFS instead of a completely new scheduler

2020-08-22 12:25:15	uoya	Super weird. I can connect to ZNC over PROXY protocol with weechat but all my other clients break

2020-08-22 12:25:51	@Leliana	it generally isn't, k8s is essentially a result of bikeshedding from people at tiny scale thinking they need orchestration software built for companies the size of facebook and the like
2020-08-22 12:26:10	uoya	I just find it a nice easy way to deploy things replicably
2020-08-22 12:26:23	uoya	And it means I get to treat all of my services the same way
2020-08-22 12:26:26	@Leliana	what's wrong with docker-compose?
2020-08-22 12:26:41	uoya	It's easier to blast away infrastructure with docker-compose
2020-08-22 12:26:52	uoya	And I can't scale things out as easily
2020-08-22 12:27:04	uoya	I like k8s because I'm interested in distributed computing, mostly
2020-08-22 12:27:33	@kori	Leliana: let the dude use his fucken kubernetes, g0d
2020-08-22 12:27:46	@Leliana	kori: I'm not stopping him, I'm giving my thoughts on k8s.
2020-08-22 12:27:48	@Leliana	God.
2020-08-22 12:28:34	uoya	I appreciate the thoughts :) 
2020-08-22 12:28:45	uoya	I had a conversation with someone on Twitter the other day, setting up what seemed like a start up 
2020-08-22 12:28:48	@kori	uoya: yaml feels like it's so, so fragile
2020-08-22 12:28:57	uoya	I think it was closer to: "I'm building an app, that might need to scale a ton"
2020-08-22 12:29:12	uoya	I tried to walk them back from k8s, because it's a lot of cognitive overhead compared to just running something on baremetal
2020-08-22 12:29:21	uoya	kori: haha, it can be ;) 
2020-08-22 12:29:58	@kori	a lot of configs at work use yaml
2020-08-22 12:30:02	@kori	i think all of them are yaml
2020-08-22 12:30:32	@kori	and it always feels like if i look at it wrong it'll break
2020-08-22 12:31:05	@Leliana	that's just you
2020-08-22 12:31:11	@Leliana	don't mix tabs and spaces and you really cannot go wrong
2020-08-22 12:31:27	@Leliana	It's basically just a human readable version of json
2020-08-22 12:31:30	@kori	i set my editor to always use 2 spaces when i am writing yaml
2020-08-22 12:31:48	@Leliana	and when I say that, I mean it
2020-08-22 12:31:48	@kori	json is pretty readable, it's just hard to write
2020-08-22 12:31:53	@Leliana	json is actually 100% valid yaml
2020-08-22 12:32:22	@kori	np: Caravan by Duke Ellington & Juan Tizol
2020-08-22 12:33:07	@Leliana	I certainly wouldn't use yaml for data storage or transfer, but for config files designed for humans, you can't really do much better
2020-08-22 12:33:17	@Leliana	HOCON is just a slightly more verbose json
2020-08-22 12:33:27	@Leliana	TOML is just INI with some typing features
2020-08-22 12:33:33	@kori	i like toml
2020-08-22 12:33:39	@Leliana	and as we know, INI fucking SUCKS for nesting things
2020-08-22 12:34:11	@kori	Leliana: what about the way toml does it?
2020-08-22 12:34:15	@kori	not sure if its different from ini
2020-08-22 12:34:42	@Leliana	kori: the way toml does it is terrible IMO
2020-08-22 12:34:49	@Leliana	so much repetition
2020-08-22 12:36:17	@kori	shrug, i like it
2020-08-22 12:36:22	uoya	oh sweeeeet

2020-08-30 22:11:39	@Leliana	<@nf> i'm not complicated. i just want a terminal that supports bitmap fonts, fallback fonts for CJK glyphs, colour emoji, copy/pasting, switching between different cursor shapes, live reloading, padding, URL matching but not in a buggy way like urxvt, and that's standalone
2020-08-30 22:11:45	@Leliana	you mean like alacritty?
